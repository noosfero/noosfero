h2. Setting the quota value

p. You can set any numeric value as the upload of the quota, but note that the value will be interpreted as Megabytes. Zero is a valid value, but will mean that the profile cannot upload any files.

p. If you left the field blank, the profile will have an unlimited upload quota. That is the default value for all profiles.

p. After choosing the quota value, just click "Save".

h2. Precedence of upload quotas

p. The default quota for a profile is unlimited, unless a custom value was set to its type. If the profile has several types with different quota values, the biggest quota will be considered. If a custom quota was set directly for the profile, this value will always be used, and the quotas for its types will always be overwritten.

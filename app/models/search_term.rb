  # Fast way of getting the occurrences score for each search_term. Ugly but fast!
  #
  # Each occurrence of a search_term has a score that is smaller the older the
  # occurrence happened. We subtract the amount of time between now and the
  # moment it happened from the total time any occurrence is valid to happen. E.g.:
  # The expiration time is 100 days and an occurrence happened 3 days ago.
  # Therefore the score is 97. Them we sum every score to get the total score
  # for a search term.
